Checking out the project:

1) Pull the project onto the hard disk somehow by checking out or updating

2) Open Android Studio

3)
	a) If the start screen is a small box saying "Welcome to Android Studio" at the top, navigate to the 'pIII' folder and select the android appllication (it will have a green circle)
	b) If you're in the main program, at the top left click: File > Open > (find the location above and select it, green circle and all from 3a)

4) On the toolbar, the 4th from the right is the AVD manager (a purple cellphone), click it, and run the virtual device (it will take 5 or so minutes to load up). If you don't have a virtual device, create one (I'm using:  Nexus_5_API_23_x86, Google APIs, x86, 1080x1920)

5) Find on the project view on the left side:
	app > java > csc207.airline > MainActivity
	Double click that file, then you can run it

Now you should see it running and you can add your stuff.
